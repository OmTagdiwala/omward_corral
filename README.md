27 Hours of coding :|

About:
Omward Corral is based off the well known password manager Password Corral, known to store passwords locally rather than online. Omward Corral works the same.
Om made this project for High Seas, from Hack Club, and also for his own learning

Note:
Omward Corral uses encryption and has some level of security with the passwords but is not nearly as secure as professional password managers and is not intended to be used as an actual password manager
Omward Corral was only made by Om Tagdiwala as a project to learn and apply concepts such as encryption, emailing, gui, and data writing
